# Ckproof

Ckproof is an automated proof checker used to verify the treatise at
[ckproof.io](http://ckproof.io). It's currently in pre-alpha, so there's not
really much to see yet. Instructions for building what little has been
implemented can be found at the
[ckproof-server](https://github.com/TopologicallySpeaking/ckproof-server)
repository.
